# Hoobank SPA
https://hoobank-demo.netlify.app/

Basic SPA with React and CSS using a mobile-first approach. 
The website is fully responsive, from 375px onwards and has basic state management and refs, especially for responsiveness purposes.   
<br/>
The site is meant as a demo landing page, so the links are just dummies. If it wasn't a demo page, the links would be implemented with React Router. At the moment they are just hrefs.

This site was inspired by the Figma prototype for Hoobank linked below. All programming was done by me.

Thanks to One Week Wonders studio for the great design and assets.
